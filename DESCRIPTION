Title: Simulating differential distributions for Beta-Poisson models
Version: 0.1
Author: Roman Schefzik
Maintainer: Roman Schefzik <roman.schefzik@medma.uni-heidelberg.de>
Description: The package provides functions to generate differential distributions of different types and different degrees (from weak to strong) for Beta-Poisson models. A specific focus is given to the application in the context of single-cell RNA-sequencing data, but the procedures can in principle also be employed in other application areas.
