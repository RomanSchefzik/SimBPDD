\title{Creates manipulated samples for simulations involving Beta-Poisson models}
\usage{
bp.sim.manipulated(Res.par,N2,case,degree,seedex)
}
\arguments{
\item{Res.par}{matrix including the fitted parameters for the well-fitted control instances that are to be manipulated (e.g. the output matrix parameters.bp.wellfit from the \code{bp.sim.control} function)}

\item{N2}{size of the samples drawn from the manipulated BP models}

\item{case}{case corresponding to a specific parameter manipulation in the BP model; specifically, case can be one of "DLambda", "DAlpha", "DBeta", "DAlphaBeta" or "DPZ" following the design and the respective descriptive table in Schefzik (2020)}

\item{degree}{parameter to set the degree of the created difference (low to strong), see Schefzik (2020) for details and the choice of a range of possible values}

\item{seedex}{seed used for sampling from the fitted BP models to ensure reproducibility}
}
\value{
matrix with simulated manipulated single-cell RNA-sequencing expression data of dimension KxN2, where K is the number of well-fitted genes by the BP models for which the desired manipulation is feasible, see Schefzik (2020) for details
}
\description{
Creates manipulated samples based on the control samples for simulations involving Beta-Poisson (BP) models
}
\details{
Creates manipulated samples based on the control samples for simulations involving BP models. Details regarding the design of the manipulations can be found in Schefzik (2020).
